  Commission rebates are a small but rapidly growing part of the NYC real estate
  market. As more buyers get their rebates and tell their friends, buyer
  awareness is only increasing. But as a relatively new concept, there is also a
  lot of misinformation about commission rebates. We’ve already answered common
  questions like how do they work and are they legal but we thought it was time
  to address another in depth – why does Yoreevo openly offer commission
  rebates?

# What does it mean to openly offer commission rebates?



Any agent at any brokerage can offer a commission rebate. Whether they will, of course, is a whole other story. We’re willing to bet that most successful agents in NYC have given a commission rebate at some point. Not in the form of a check but as a reduced commission.



For example, say Buyer Joe has submitted his best offer of $895,000 but Seller Jane won’t accept anything less than $900,000. One or both agents may reduce their commission to bridge that gap. This is effectively a commission rebate and happens all the time.



Yoreevo, on the other hand, tells all buyers we would be happy to get them a commission rebate. No haggling, no preferential treatment, no deal impasse required. Anyone can go on our website and see how it works. This is what we mean by openly offering commission rebates.
